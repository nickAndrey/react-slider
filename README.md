# Slider Component

The `Slider` component is a customizable, responsive carousel/slider for your React application.

## Props

- `children`: The slides you want to display in the carousel. This can be any valid React node.
- `config`: An optional configuration object that can be used to customize the behavior of the carousel.

## State Variables

- `trackWidth`: The width of the track that the slides move along.
- `slideWidth`: The width of each individual slide.
- `currentSlide`: The index of the currently displayed slide.
- `touchStart`: The x-coordinate of the point where the user started touching the screen (for touch devices).
- `touchEnd`: The x-coordinate of the point where the user stopped touching the screen (for touch devices).

## Methods

- `moveToTheNextSlide`: Moves the carousel to the next slide. If the carousel is already at the last slide, it will not move.

## Usage

```tsx
import Slider from './Slider';

<Slider config={{ slidesToShow: 3 }}>
  <div>Slide 1</div>
  <div>Slide 2</div>
  <div>Slide 3</div>
  {/* More slides... */}
</Slider>;
```

In this example, the `Slider` component will display 3 slides at a time. You can customize this by changing the `slidesToShow` property in the `config` prop.
